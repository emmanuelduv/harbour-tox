# harbour-tox
Tox client for Sailfish OS on Jolla phone

This is now a first version of Tox (https://tox.chat/) client for Sailfish OS, it may be able to send and receive text message. I did not test it for a long time on my Jolla and it may drain the battery... Current version must be launched from command line in a writable directory.

All others tox features are yet missing :
 - File transfert & avatars
 - Video/Voice call
 - Chat room

Patchs to correct bugs or add new features are welcome!
